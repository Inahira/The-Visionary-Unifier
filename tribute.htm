                        distinguished physicist known for his groundbreaking work in the field of theoretical physics.
                        He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for his contribution to electroweak
                        unification, which unified two of the fundamental forces in the universe.</p>
                    <p class="bio-para">Despite facing challenges and discrimination due to his religious beliefs, Dr.
                        Salam remained dedicated to his scientific pursuits and went on to become a global figure in the
                        world of physics.</p>

                    <p class="x-para">Dr. Salam completed his undergraduate studies at Government College, Lahore,
                        before pursuing his doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of Cambridge, England.
                        His remarkable intellect and dedication to the pursuit of knowledge earned him recognition and
                        respect from the international scientific community.</p>
                    <p class="x-para">Dr. Salam's dedication to education extended beyond his own research. He was a
                        passionate advocate for science education in developing countries and worked tirelessly to
                        create opportunities for aspiring scientists in his homeland of Pakistan and around the world.
